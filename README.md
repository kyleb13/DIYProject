# DIYProject

This project acts as a management tool for people who are working or planning to work on a diy project. It lets you select materials, estimate costs, import/export projects, etc. It also allows you to import scans of electric bills to keep track of electricity costs/usage

To run this project, just run the out.jar file. Alternatively, you can load the project into an ide and run MainWindow.java.
